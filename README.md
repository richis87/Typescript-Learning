# 📘 TypeScript Learning

This repository contains practice projects, exercises, and experiments created while learning and improving my TypeScript skills.

It's structured to explore both the fundamentals and some advanced features of TypeScript through hands-on examples.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand TypeScript's type system and benefits over JavaScript
- Practice real-world use cases: interfaces, generics, classes, and more
- Apply modern development patterns using TypeScript
- Build a strong foundation for frontend/backend projects (Angular, NestJS, Node.js, etc.)

---

## 📚 Topics Covered (or planned)

- ✅ Basic types and type inference
- ✅ Functions and arrow functions
- ✅ Interfaces and type aliases
- ✅ Classes and object-oriented programming
- ✅ Generics
- ✅ Enums, tuples, and union types
- ✅ Modules and namespaces
- ✅ Working with JSON and APIs
- ✅ Type guards and narrowing
- 🔜 Decorators and metadata
- 🔜 TypeScript with Node.js or Deno
